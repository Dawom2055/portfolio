<h1>
  Let's Talk About Crunchyroll 

</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          Today I am going to try and give a breakdown analysis on why I think Crunchyroll is such a good product, the reasoning behind the companies success, and why I use it on a daily basis and pay for its subscription over other anime streaming platforms such as Funimation, AnimeFreak, etc.        </p>

        <p>
          Crunchyroll is the world's largest anime streaming platform that was recently bought out by Sony for $1.2 billion dollars. It has been reported that the San Francisco-based Crunchyroll is generating over 83 million dollars in only subscription revenue, which is a great feat considering the company was founded in 2006. So what is the reasoning behind Crunchyrolls success and why is the growth potential for this company so high? The simple answer is Anime.
        </p>
        
        <p>
         
          Anime is something that is becoming a common thing within households, it's an industry that many people are starting to acknowledge and the success we are seeing within this industry is just the beginning. It has been reported that the Anime Market is valued at 24.23 Billion dollars in 2020 and anticipated to reach 43.73 Billion dollars by 2027, almost doubling its value within 7 years compared to the 24.23 billion since the day anime was streamed. As someone who started watching anime at the age of 9 or 10 and progressively seeing people around me who I thought would never enjoy anime and make fun of it, now waiting on when the next episode comes out. The growth we see for anime is just the beginning and Crunchyroll has a head start within this industry compared to other companies.
        

        </p>

        <p>
          There are many positive things that Crunchyroll does that attracts anime watchers to their product. Such as offering over 1000 anime shows and all being displayed at a high quality for users no matter the subscription plan they have chosen. Crunchyroll is steadfast on release times for new episodes and matches the release date in Japan for users around the world. It offers users to watch anime subbed in various different languages such as English, Espanol, Portuges, etc. But even though Crunchyroll provides all of these things to its users I still believe there are many things Crunchyroll needs to improve on that will play a huge part in their growth.
        
          
        </p>

<p>
  The first thing Crunchyroll needs to implement is giving users an option to watch their favourite shows in dubbed. Yes there are some animes that Crunchyroll provides in dubbed but it only totals to around 26 animes which is nothing compared to the 1000+ shows Crunchyroll has to offer, giving a percentile rate of only 2.6% of animes in Crunchyroll being offered in dubbed. Another thing is widening their exposure to more popular and mainstream anime that they donâ€™t provide for their users. Animes such as Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, and Dororo were all anime that I had to watch on different streaming platforms such as Funimation or Amazon prime video which really defeats the purpose for me to be paying for a Crunchyroll Premium membership. Lastly, and personally I think this is the biggest one. I believe Crunchyroll needs to work on the user experience on their platform. The site overall is not appealing and the user's experience when watching anime is not the greatest. To justify my point I want to bring up things that Netflix does that make users want to keep using their platform over others. Small things such as when watching a show you can double tap the right side to skip a couple of seconds and double click the left side to go back a couple of seconds. Netflix provides users with buttons to skip intros, skip intro songs, and start the next episode when the current one is about to end. These are some small examples of UI changes that Cruncyroll needs to implement to drag people towards their product more and more.
