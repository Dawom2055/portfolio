  What makes Crunchyroll such a good product? 

</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          Well today I am going to try and try to do a breakdown analysis on why I think Crunchyroll is such a good product and why I use and pay for Crunchyroll over other platforms such as Funimation, AnimeFreak, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crunchyroll is the world's largest anime streaming platform that was recently bought out by Sony for $1.2 billion dollars. It has been reported that the San Francisco-based Crunchyroll is generating over 83 million dollars in only subscription revenue. So what is the reasoning behind Crunchyrolls success and why is the growth potential fort this company so high. The simple answer is Anime.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Anime is something that is becoming a common thing within households and is something that will keep growing and this is just the beginning. It has been reported that the Anime Market is valued at 24.23 Billion dollars in 2020 and anticipated to reach 43.73 Billion dollars by 2027. Anime is something that was once thought of as something for only children to enjoy but now it’s a custom to see the older generation even enjoying streaming anime within their homes and being passed on to the younger generation. As someone who started watching anime at the age of 9 or 10 and progressively seeing people around me who I thought would never enjoy anime and make fun of it, now waiting on when the next episode is coming out. The growth we see for Anime is just the beginning and Crunchyroll has a headstart from any other company within this industry. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many positive things that Crunchyroll does that attaches anime watchers to their product. Such as offering over 1000 anime shows and all being displayed at a high quality for users. Crunchyroll is also really up to date on release times for new episodes and matches the release date in Japan for users around the world. It offers users to watch anime subtitled in various different languages such as English, Espanol, Portuges, etc. But even though Crucnhyroll provides all of these things to its users I still believe there are many things Crunchyroll needs to improve on and could be a huge part in their growth within the anime industry. 
        </p>

<p>
  The first thing Crunchyroll needs to implement is giving users an option to watch their favourite shows in dubbed. Yes there are some animes that Crunchyroll provides in dubbed but it only totals to around 26 animes which is so little compares to the 1000 and more shoes Crunchyroll has to offer, giving a percentile rate of only 2.6% of animes in Crunchyroll being offered in dubbed. Another thing is widening their exposure to more popular anime that they don't have to offer. I had to watch the following anime: Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, Dororo on different streaming platform such as Funimation or Amazon prime video which really doesn’t make sense since I’m paying for Crunchyroll Premium to watch anime, and ultimately doesn’t provide me with mainstream animes I want to watch. Last;y, and personally I think this is the biggest one. I believe Crunchyroll needs to work on the user interface of their platform. The site overall is not appealing and the users anime watching experience is not the best. To justify my point I want to bring up things that Netflix does that make users want to keep using their platform over others. Small things such as when watching a show you can double tap the right side to skip a couple of seconds and double click the left side to go back a couple of seconds. Netflix provides users a button to skip the intro of the episode instead of having to manually keep clicking the fast forward button until the intro is done which can be quite a hassle and can even make your video lag for a couple of seconds. These are small little things but I genuinely believe it will make Crunchyroll have a much better user experience and drag people towards their product more and more.
